# [WIP] clrfund.js 

The goal of the project is to make it easy for frontend developers to build dapps on top of clr.fund protocol. With clrfund-js and [clrfund-deployer](https://github.com/clrfund/clrfund-deployer), developers could easily run CLR rounds for funding public goods in their own community. Hope this project can promote the implementation of localized CLR all over the world.
